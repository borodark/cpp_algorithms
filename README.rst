How to start
============

#.  Clone template:
#.  Change default repository. Assuming you are in project directory:
    ::

        git remote rename origin template
        git remote add origin ${REPOSITORY}
        git push -u origin master

    Here ``${REPOSITORY}`` is the URL of your public repository (at 
    `github <github.com>`_ or somewhere else).

#.  Replace ``README.rst`` with yours.

Filesystem layout
============
#.  CMake/Modules/   Cmake modules and platform defaults (compiler flags) 
#.  CMakeFiles/      Generated by cmake. (Nothing inside needs attention, ignore it) 
#.  lib/             Shared library that lives separately of the main application. 
#.  src/               Main src code directory for the binary. All code in /lib can be used here. 

*Notes on lib/*

#.  Used to provide external functionality such as integration with other C-Call convention applications. 
#.  Not needed if you have nothing to expose to other applications. 
#.  When compiling, nothing in src/ is visible to code in /lib. 


Things to reconfigure
============

#.  Edit CMakeLists.txt and change the application name, version numbers, and [release|debug] build mode.
#.  Add any Cmake dependencies if your project uses other libraries.
#.  If no shared library is desired, remove lib/ and the CMakeLists.txt references to it.

How to build
============

#.  Run Cmake:
    ::
        cmake .

#.  Run Make
    ::
        make

#.  Run the application from the src/Debug or src/Release folder depending on the build type.
